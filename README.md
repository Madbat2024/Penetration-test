## PHASE ONE: RECON

To effectively conduct a penetration test on Artemis, Incorporated using Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), we will deploy a comprehensive set of tools and techniques tailored to extract crucial data from public sources. Our methodology encompasses the following:

### Social Media: 

We will employ tools such as Hootsuite and BuzzSumo to monitor Artemis's social media footprint across platforms. These tools allow us to track mentions, analyze content popularity, and identify key personnel within the company.

### Search Engines: 

Advanced search operators in Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo will be utilized to unearth information that is not immediately apparent through standard searches. This includes indexing of company-related PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, and other documents.

### Job Boards: 

Platforms like Indeed, Glassdoor, and LinkedIn Jobs will be scoured to find job listings by Artemis. These listings can reveal technology stacks, departmental structures, and other internal insights.

### Company Research: 

Crunchbase for startup information, Hoovers for comprehensive company data, and the Wayback Machine to view historical snapshots of the Artemis website. This aids in understanding company evolution, funding rounds, and strategic shifts.

### Domain and IP Research: 

Tools such as Whois Lookup, DNSdumpster, and Shodan will provide insights into Artemis’s domain registrations, DNS records, and exposed internet-connected devices.
Pastebins: Pastebin and Ghostbin search functionality will be leveraged to locate any leaked information or data dumps related to Artemis.
Documentation and organization of the gathered information will be streamlined through the use of digital workspaces like Notion or Microsoft OneNote, coupled with a strict naming convention for ease of access and review.

The culmination of this gathered intelligence will set the stage for identifying potential vulnerabilities and planning a targeted attack simulation. This will inform our penetration testing strategy, focusing efforts on the most likely points of failure, and thereby increasing the efficacy of our testing phase.



## PHASE 2: IDENTIFY AND RUN SCANS

Moving on to the network scans pivotal for penetrating Artemis, Incorporated's digital infrastructure, we've curated a selection of tools from the Kali Linux distribution, esteemed for its comprehensive suite of ethical hacking utilities. Our arsenal comprises:
